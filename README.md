# What is CI - CD CDE
![img.png](img.png)
## CI/CD
A CI/CD pipeline is an automated sequence of steps that development teams use to build, test, and deploy their applications. The pipeline allows developers to rapidly and reliably release new features and updates to their applications.

The pipeline consists of multiple stages, each of which performs a specific task. These stages may include:

1. Code repository: The first stage of the pipeline involves checking out the code from the version control system, where the code is stored such as GitHub.

2. Build: The code is compiled and built into an executable format.

3. Test: The code is tested using automated testing tools to identify any errors or bugs.

4. Integration: The code is integrated with other code in the application and tested again to ensure compatibility.

5. Deployment: Once the code has passed all tests, it is deployed to a staging environment for final testing and review by stakeholders.

6. Release: The code is released to production after being approved by stakeholders.

7. Monitoring: The pipeline is monitored to ensure that the application is running smoothly and any issues are quickly identified and addressed.

By using a CI/CD pipeline, developers can reduce the time and effort required for manual testing and deployment, increase the speed of delivering new features and bug fixes to users, and improve the overall quality of their software.


## Difference between CD (Code Delivery) and CDE (Code Deployment)

Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CDE) are related concepts that involve automating the software delivery process. However, they differ in terms of the level of automation involved in the deployment process.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to a production environment. Once the code has been prepared, it is then up to the development team to decide when to deploy the changes to production. The deployment process may involve manual steps, such as reviewing the changes and approving them for release.

Continuous Deployment (CDE), on the other hand, involves automatically deploying code changes to production as soon as they pass the necessary tests and checks. This means that changes are continuously delivered to end-users in a fast and reliable manner without requiring any manual intervention. The deployment process is fully automated, and once the code is ready, it is automatically released to production.

In summary, the main difference between CD and CDE is the level of automation in the deployment process. CD automates the process up until the point of release, while CDE automates the entire process of deployment.

## Jenkins

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is used to build, test, and deploy software applications. It is one of the most popular automation servers used by software development teams around the world.

Jenkins works by allowing developers to create pipelines, which are automated sequences of steps that are executed whenever a code change is made. These pipelines are typically divided into stages that are executed sequentially, with each stage performing a specific task such as compiling the code, running tests, and deploying the application.

Jenkins integrates with a wide range of tools and technologies, including version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms. This makes it highly flexible and customizable to the needs of different development teams.

One of the key features of Jenkins is its plugin architecture, which allows developers to extend its functionality by adding new plugins. This enables teams to integrate Jenkins with other tools and technologies that are critical to their development process.

In summary, Jenkins is an automation server that allows software development teams to create pipelines that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications. It is highly flexible and customizable, and integrates with a wide range of tools and technologies through its plugin architecture.

Jenkins offers a range of benefits to software development teams, including:

1. Automation: Jenkins allows teams to automate repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software applications. This reduces the time and effort required for manual tasks, and helps to ensure consistency and reliability in the development process.

2. Customization: Jenkins is highly customizable, allowing teams to create pipelines that meet their specific needs. This flexibility enables teams to integrate Jenkins with other tools and technologies that are critical to their development process.

3. Scalability: Jenkins is designed to scale up or down depending on the needs of the development team. This means that it can be used by teams of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprise organizations.

4. Integration: Jenkins integrates with a wide range of tools and technologies, including version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms. This makes it easy to integrate Jenkins into existing development processes.

5. Open-source: Jenkins is open-source software, which means that it is free to use and can be customized to meet the specific needs of the development team. This makes it accessible to a wide range of organizations and development teams.

6. Community support: Jenkins has a large and active community of developers and users who contribute to its development and provide support to users. This community support ensures that Jenkins is constantly improving and evolving to meet the needs of the development community.

## Other automation services

Some popular alternatives to Jenkins include:

1. Travis CI: This is a cloud-based continuous integration service that is widely used for building, testing, and deploying software applications.

2. CircleCI: This is a cloud-based continuous integration and delivery platform that offers a range of features such as automatic parallelism (Parallelism is the ability to perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously.) and intelligent caching.

3. GitLab CI/CD: This is an open-source continuous integration and delivery platform that is tightly integrated with GitLab, a popular source code management platform.

4. Bamboo: This is an on-premise continuous integration and deployment tool developed by Atlassian. It offers a range of features such as automated builds, test reporting, and deployment automation.

5. TeamCity: This is an on-premise continuous integration and deployment tool developed by JetBrains. It offers features such as build automation, code quality analysis, and test reporting.

These tools offer similar functionalities to Jenkins and can be used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications. The choice of tool will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the development team.
